Sennder is Europe’s leading digital freight forwarder. In a traditional industry, we are moving fast to digitize and automate all road logistics processes. We are looking for a Senior Platform Engineer that can build a healthy platform that powers all of sennder’s engineering department. Please note: we are offering this role remotely for all locations across Spain.

We value humility and we're as interested in your character as we are in your talent. Please apply, even if you feel you only meet part of our listed criteria. Diversity drives our innovation and we offer a collaborative, dynamic and international work environment. Just be yourself. We are excited to meet you and for you to join us in shaping the future of the logistics industry in Europe.

About The Role

We’re looking for a passionate Senior Platform Engineer to further grow the Platform Team which owns the sennder application infrastructure platform and related processes. We work in an agile environment supporting a growing number of cross-functional engineering pods that build user experiences to disrupt the logistics market. The domain space is complex with lots of greenfield and scalability engineering challenges to solve.

We believe in giving our autonomous teams ownership of a challenging mission and we love engineers that want to drive significant improvements and take ownership of certain parts of our roadmap. If you enjoy collaboration, can lead by example and thrive in a fast-paced environment then this could be the organization for you.

- Co-designing cloud infrastructure with a product-driven approach and implementing infrastructure as code. We are lazy and we believe in DRY!
- Crafting operational aspects of continuous integration, continuous delivery, continuous compliance, failure and security attack mitigations and performing root cause analyses.
- Building internal tooling for the team as well as engineering at large to provide uniform and coherent experience across the organization.
- Designing engineering operations for smooth functioning of delivery, processes for service disruptions, and mitigation processes during cyber-attacks.
- Extending observability with a focus on business enablement.
- Mentoring and training junior engineers on cloud technologies.

WHICH TRAITS CONTRIBUTE TO YOUR SUCCESS?

- Confident presentation and strong influence skills with adaptability based on the audience
- In depth experience with AWS and cloud native architecture
- Working with Linux and knowledge of scripting languages like BASH, Python
- Assertive communication skills for an effective collaboration between engineering, product, and operations
