> Dear European Space Agency Recruitment Team,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the IT Systems Architect position at the European Space Agency. With a background in computer engineering and extensive experience in the planning, design, and management of complex IT infrastructures, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to ESA’s  Science Programme and to support the scientific and operational excellence of the Science Operations Department.

With more than 20 years of professional experience in the IT sector, I have developed a comprehensive skill set that goes beyond traditional systems architecture. My expertise spans automation, software development, observability, and systems integration. I have led and implemented automation initiatives to streamline IT operations, enhance reliability, and reduce manual intervention. My development skills allow me to design and deploy custom solutions tailored to organizational needs, while my focus on observability ensures robust monitoring, proactive incident response, and continuous system optimization. Additionally, I have successfully managed integrations between heterogeneous platforms and services, facilitating seamless data exchange and operational efficiency across complex environments.

Throughout my career, I have developed and implemented robust IT infrastructure solutions, integrating servers, storage, computing, and virtual environments, always with a focus on scalability, security, and operational efficiency. My experience managing multidisciplinary IT projects, combined with a deep understanding of communication networks, aligns closely with the responsibilities outlined for this role. 

I have successfully led teams in the definition and execution of IT infrastructure roadmaps, ensuring alignment with organisational strategy and evolving technological trends. My roles have required close collaboration with internal stakeholders and external vendors, as well as the management of procurement processes and service contracts—areas in which I have consistently delivered results within budget and schedule. I am also familiar with the importance of compliance with security directives and have supported security officers to ensure that IT systems adhere to stringent cybersecurity policies.

ESA’s commitment to innovation, continuous improvement, and fostering cooperation resonates deeply with my own values. I am adept at monitoring and integrating emerging technologies, and I believe my forward-thinking approach will help maintain ESA’s IT infrastructure at the forefront of scientific research and operations.

I am fluent in English and I am a national of Spain, an ESA Member State. I am confident that my technical expertise, project management skills, and passion for space science make me a strong candidate for this position.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility to discuss how my experience and skills can contribute to the European Space Agency.

Sincerely,
Sergio Sánchez Vega
