> Dear Wikimedia Foundation Recruitment Team,

I am writing to express my interest in the Staff Site Reliability Engineer (Machine Learning Infrastructure) position. With over seven years of experience designing, building, and optimizing cloud-native and on-premises infrastructure for mission-critical systems, I am eager to bring my expertise and passion for reliability engineering to Wikimedia’s mission of free knowledge for all.

In my current role as Staff Site Reliability Engineer at Raisin GMBH, I have led the migration to modern CI/CD platforms, engineered enhancements to Kubernetes (EKS) clusters, and pioneered group-level monitoring solutions using open-source tools such as Prometheus, Victoria Metrics, and Grafana. My hands-on experience with infrastructure-as-code (Terraform, Ansible, Helm, Argo Workflows), as well as my commitment to automation and observability, has enabled my teams to achieve significant improvements in efficiency, reliability, and cost optimization. I have consistently worked in distributed, multicultural environments, collaborating with developers, product teams, and engineers to streamline workflows and troubleshoot complex systems.

Although I have not yet had the opportunity to work directly with machine learning infrastructure, I am highly adept at acquiring new technical skills and adapting to emerging technologies. Throughout my career, I have demonstrated my ability to quickly master complex systems and tools-such as Kubernetes, Terraform, and advanced observability stacks-by leveraging my strong analytical and problem-solving skills. I am confident that my solid foundation in infrastructure, automation, and cloud-native technologies, combined with my passion for continuous learning, will allow me to rapidly become proficient in the machine learning infrastructure domain and contribute effectively to your team.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my experience and skills can contribute to the Wikimedia Foundation.

Sincerely,
Sergio Sánchez Vega
